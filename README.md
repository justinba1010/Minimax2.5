# Minimax2.5
The idea behind this is to work on a comprehensive Minimax search AI that doesn't need to be reconfigured for each game. Instead through polymorphism and the such, having a single Node object that can be reconfigured with other game objects, and put all together with an AI object.
I would love pull requests and comments, so go ahead and make them.
